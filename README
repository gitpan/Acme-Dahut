# Acme::Dahut - A module for the Higher Circles

Acme::Dahut is the produce of the deranged imaginations of the #axkit
Higher Circles.

As far as I know, it's the only module the constructor of which returns
a blessed LVALUE. But this is to be expected, as it powerfully captures
the business logic of a Left Dahut.


  use Acme::Dahut qw(:right); # dies, this is a left dahut
  use Acme::Dahut qw(:left);

  my $dahut = Acme::Dahut->new;
  $dahut->call;


One of the main centers of dahut-lore is #axkit, on irc.rhizomatic.net
(or london.rhizomatic.net for us euros).

You may find an occasional mention of dahut-knowledge from
http://use.perl.org/~darobin/journal/, but just as well you may not.
Such is the way of the dahut.

The current ultimate reference is http://berjon.com/dahut.txt .

A collection of Zen Dahut Poetry by Kip Hampton and Barrie Slaymaker
is confidently expected any decade now.
